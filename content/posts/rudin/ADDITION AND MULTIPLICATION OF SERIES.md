**3.47 Theorem** If $\Sigma a_{n}=A$, and $\Sigma b_{n}=B$, then $\Sigma\left(a_{n}+b_{n}\right)=A+B$, and $\Sigma c a_{n}=c A$, for any fixed $c$.
Proof Let
$$
A_{n}=\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_{k}, \quad B_{n}=\sum_{k=0}^{n} b_{k}
$$
Then
$$
A_{n}+B_{n}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\left(a_{k}+b_{k}\right) \text {. }
$$
Since $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} A_{n}=A$ and $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} B_{n}=B$, we see that
$$
\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(A_{n}+B_{n}\right)=A+B
$$
The proof of the second assertion is even simpler.

Thus two convergent series may be added term by term, and the resulting series converges to the sum of the two series. The situation becomes more complicated when we consider multiplication of two series. To begin with, we have to define the product. This can be done in several ways; we shall consider the so-called "'Cauchy product."
