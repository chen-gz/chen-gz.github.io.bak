## Hitting with one matrix and then another 

Here's a perpframe $p_{1}=\left(\begin{array}{c}\cos (s) \\ \sin (s)\end{array}\right)$ and $p_{2}=\left(\begin{array}{r}-\sin (s) \\ \cos (s)\end{array}\right)$ specified by angle $s=\frac{\pi}{3}$.

Plot an ellipse with a minor axis of $0.5$ in the direction of $\mathbf{p}_{1}$ and major axis of $1.2$ in the direction of $\mathbf{p}_{2}$.

----

**Answer:** You know how to plot the unit circle: 

ParametricPlot $\left[\left(\begin{array}{l}\operatorname{Cos}[t] \\ \operatorname{Sin}[t]\end{array}\right),\{\mathrm{t}, 0,2 \pi\}\right]$

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chen-gz/picBed/master/20210604171940.png)

You know how to use an xy-stretcher to stretch the circle into an ellipse with the desired axes lengths: 

stretcher $=\left(\begin{array}{cc}0.5 & 0 \\ 0 & 1.2\end{array}\right)$
ParametricPlot [stretcher $\left.\left(\begin{array}{c}\cos [t] \\ \text { Sin[t] }\end{array}\right),\{\mathrm{t}, 0,2 \pi\}\right]$

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chen-gz/picBed/master/20210604172000.png)

The ellipse you're looking at now is given by $\left(\begin{array}{cc}0.5 & 0 \\ 0 & 1.2\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{l}\cos [\mathrm{t}] \\ \sin [\mathrm{t}]\end{array}\right)$.

All you need to do is hang the ellipse on the perpendicular frame.
To do that you hit the curve $\left(\begin{array}{cc}0.5 & 0 \\ 0 & 1.2\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}\cos [t] \\ \sin [t]\end{array}\right)$ with the nanger matrix.

hanger $=\left(\mathrm{p}_{1} \mid \mathrm{p}_{2}\right)$

Parametricplot [hanger (stretcher $\left(\begin{array}{l}\cos [t] \\ \text { Sin[t] }\end{array}\right)$ ) , \{t, 0, 2}

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chen-gz/picBed/master/20210604172056.png)

An ellipse with a minor axis of $0.5$ in the direction of $\mathbf{p}_{1}$ and major axis of $1.2$ in the direction of $\mathbf{p}_{2}$.

Just what the doctor ordered. 

------

In the problem above you used two matrix hits to plot an ellipse. 

Plot the same ellipse again, but this time use only one matrix hit. 

**Answer:** Above, you defined a stretcher matrix and a hanger matrix and then plotted the results of a hit with the stretcher followed by a hit with the hanger: 

ParametricPlot [hanger (stretcher $\left.\left(\begin{array}{l}\cos [\mathrm{t}] \\ \text { Sin[t] }\end{array}\right)\right\},\{\mathrm{t}, 0,2$ )

If you multiply the out (hanger) (stretcher) you get:
$$
\text { product }=(\text { hanger }) \text { (stretcher) }=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
0.25 & -1.03923 \\
0.433013 & 0.6
\end{array}\right) .
$$
Now hit the unit circle with the product:
ParametricPlot [product $\left.\left(\begin{array}{l}\cos [t] \\ \operatorname{Sin}[t]\end{array}\right),\{t, 0,2 \pi\}\right]$

Apparently, 

the action of the matrix product: **product = (hanger) (stretcher)** 

is the same as 

the action of the **stretcher** followed by the action of the **hanger**. 
 
 

**Key point:** The action of a matrix product: *A=B C* is the same as the action of the *C* followed by the action of *B*.

## The point on a line through {0,0} closest to *P*.

Here's a plot of the point $P=\{2,1\}$.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chen-gz/picBed/master/20210604172302.png)

What point on the $x$ -axis is closest to the point $\{2,1\} ?$
Answer: It's gotta be the point $\{2,0\}$.

What point on the $\mathrm{y}$ -axis is closest to the point $\{2,1\} ?$
Answer: It's gotta be the point $\{0,1\}$.

-------

How can you get these closest points with matrix hits?
Answer: To get the closest point on the $\mathrm{x}$ -axis, hit $\{2,1\}$ with the $\mathrm{xy}$ -stretcher that squashes the $\mathrm{y}$ -coordinate but leaves the x-coordinate unchanged.
The $x y$ -stretcher you want is $\left(\begin{array}{ll}1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0\end{array}\right)$.
Check: $\left(\begin{array}{ll}1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{l}2 \\ 1\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{l}2 \\ 0\end{array}\right)$

To get the closest point on the y-axis hit $\{2,1\}$ with the $x y$ -stretcher that squashes the $x$ -coordinate but leaves the y-coordinate unchanged.
The $x y$ -stretcher you want is $\left(\begin{array}{ll}0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{array}\right)$.
Check: $\left(\begin{array}{ll}0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{l}2 \\ 1\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{l}0 \\ 1\end{array}\right)$

Here's a plot of a perpframe and the point $\mathrm{P}=\{2,1\}$.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chen-gz/picBed/master/20210604172441.png)

The plot also shows lines through $\{0,0\}$ parallel to $\mathbf{p}_{1}$ and $\mathbf{p}_{2}$
What point on the green line is closest to the point $\mathrm{P}=\{2,1\}$ ?

---

Answer: This is a lot harder than asking what point on the $x$ -axis is closest to $\{2,1\}$.
Look at the following plots.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chen-gz/picBed/master/20210604172507.png)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chen-gz/picBed/master/20210604172514.png)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chen-gz/picBed/master/20210604172520.png)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chen-gz/picBed/master/20210604172528.png)

$\mathrm{S}$ is the point on the green line closest to $\{2,1\}$.
Explain how the $\mathrm{S}$ got where it did.

----

**Answer:** Look again at the first two plots. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chen-gz/picBed/master/20210604172744.png)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chen-gz/picBed/master/20210604172807.png)

You get from the first plot to the second plot by rotating the perpframe vectors $\mathbf{p}_{1}$ and $\mathbf{p}_{2}$ to the $\mathrm{x}$ and $\mathrm{y}$ axes.
This rotates the green line to the $x$ -axis and the point $p$ to the new position 0 .
You get this rotation with the aligner $=\left(\frac{\mathbf{p}_{1}}{\mathbf{p}_{2}}\right)$.

-----

Look at the second and third plots: 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chen-gz/picBed/master/20210604172841.png)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chen-gz/picBed/master/20210604172857.png)

$\mathrm{R}$ is the point on the $\mathrm{x}$ -axis closest to $\mathrm{Q}$.
You can get $\mathrm{R}$ by hitting $\mathrm{Q}$ with the stretcher $=\left(\begin{array}{ll}1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0\end{array}\right)$.
This squashes Q's y-coordinate, but leaves the x-coordinate unchanged.

-----

Look at the third and fourth plots: 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chen-gz/picBed/master/20210604172926.png)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chen-gz/picBed/master/20210604172943.png)

Here you rotate the xy-axis back to the perpframe vectors.
The point $\mathrm{R}$ gets rotated to $\mathrm{S}$.
This is a job for the hanger $=\left(\mathbf{p}_{1} \mid \mathbf{p}_{2}\right)$.

----

Summary: You arrived at $\mathrm{S}$ by hitting $\mathrm{P}$,
- first with aligner $=\left(\frac{\mathbf{p}_{1}}{\mathbf{p}_{2}}\right)$,
- then with stretcher $=\left(\begin{array}{ll}1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0\end{array}\right)$,
- and finally with hanger $=\left(\mathbf{p}_{1} \mid \mathbf{p}_{2}\right)$.

This says you can get the coordinates of the point on the green line closest to $\mathrm{p}$ by computing
(hanger) (strecher) (aligmer) $\mathrm{P}$.

Compute this point and add it to the plot
closestGreen = (hanger) $\left(\begin{array}{ll}1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0\end{array}\right)$ (aligner) P
$\{0.600338,1.54416\}$

Looks good. 

-----

Take a look at the original setup again.
What point on the blue line is closest to the point $\{2,1\} ?$

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chen-gz/picBed/master/20210604173133.png)

Answer: This time you should try to imagine the picture for each step:
- Use the aligner matrix to rotate the $\mathrm{p}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{p}_{2}$ to the $\mathrm{xy}$ -axis.
  This rotates $\mathrm{P}$ to a new position $\mathrm{Q}$.
- Use a stretcher matrix to find the point on the y-axis (the new location of the blue line) closest to $\mathrm{Q}$.
- Use the hanger matrix to rotate back to the original perpframe.

This says that (hanger) $\left(\begin{array}{ll}0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{array}\right)$ (aligner) $\mathrm{P}$ should give you the point on the blue line closest to $\mathrm{P}$.
You use $\left(\begin{array}{ll}0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{array}\right)$ for the stretcher since you want to squash the $x$ but leave the y unchanged.
Compute closestBlue = (hanger) $\left(\begin{array}{ll}0 & 0 \\ 0\end{array}\right)$ (aligner) $\mathrm{P}$ and add it to the plot.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chen-gz/picBed/master/20210604173217.png)

Looks good. 

-----

It's good to be able to imagine all of the matrix action that leads from $\mathrm{p}$ to the blue dot, but you deserve to see it too.

## The point on a plane through {0,0,0} closest to *P*.

Here's a plot of a point $\mathrm{P}=\{1,-1,1\}$ and a perpframe $\left\{p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}\right\} .$

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chen-gz/picBed/master/20210604173410.png)

The plot also shows the plane through $\{0,0,0\}$ spanned by $\mathbf{p}_{1}$ and $\mathbf{p}_{2}$
What point on the plane is closest to the point $\mathrm{P}=\{1,-1,1\} ?$

-------

Answer this question in stages. 

First align the plane spanned by $p_1$ and $p_2$ with the xy-plane. 

Do this by hitting with the aligner $=\left(\frac{\frac{p_{1}}{p_{z}}}{p_{3}}\right)$.
$$
\mathrm{Q}=\left(\frac{\frac{\mathrm{p}_{1}}{\mathrm{p}_{2}}}{\mathrm{p}_{3}}\right) \mathrm{P}
$$
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chen-gz/picBed/master/20210604173551.png)

The aligner has rotated the perpframe to xyz-axis. 

The original plane has been rotated to the xy-plane. 

The point P has been rotated to the point Q. 

The distances from P to the original plane are the same as distances from Q to the xy-plane. 

But finding the point on the xy-plane closest to Q is a snap. 

Just hit Q with a stretcher matrix that leaves the x and y coordinates unchanged, but squashes the z coordinate. 
$$
R=\left(\begin{array}{lll}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right) Q=\left(\begin{array}{lll}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right)\left(\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}\right) P
$$
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chen-gz/picBed/master/20210604173623.png)

Now hang the plane back in its original position to find the point closest to $\mathrm{P}$.
Do this with the hanger matrix.
$$
S=\left(p_{1}\left|p_{2}\right| p_{3}\right) R=\left(p_{1}\left|p_{2}\right| p_{3}\right)\left(\begin{array}{lll}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right)\left(\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}\right) P
$$

Summary: You arrived at $\mathrm{S}$, the point on the plane closest to $\mathrm{P}$, by hitting $\mathrm{P}$,
- first with aligner $=\left(\frac{\underline{\mathbf{p}} \mathbf{1}}{\underline{\mathbf{p}}} \mid\right.$,
$\bullet$ then with stretcher $=\left(\begin{array}{lll}1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0\end{array}\right)$,
- and finally with hanger $=(\mathbf{p} \mathbf{1}|\mathbf{p} 2| \mathbf{p} \mathbf{3})$.
This says you can get the coordinates of the point on the green line closest to $\mathrm{p}$ by computing (hanger) (stretcher) (aligner) $\mathrm{P}$

-----

Simplified formulas.
You'll see later that the product ( $\mathbf{p} \mathbf{1}|\mathbf{p} \mathbf{2}| \mathbf{p}$ 3 ) $\left(\begin{array}{lll}1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0\end{array}\right)\left(\frac{\mathbf{p} \mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{p}^{2}}\right)$ simplifies to just $\left(\mathbf{p} \mathbf{1} \mid \mathbf{p}^{2}\right)\left(\frac{\mathbf{p} \mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{p} 2}\right)$.
More generally, (but without the pictures), if
- $\left\{\vec{p}_{1}, \vec{p}_{2}, \ldots, \vec{p}_{m}\right\}$ is an orthonormal basis for $\mathbb{R}^{m}$

- and $S$ is the subspace spanned by $\left\{\vec{p}_{1}, \vec{p}_{2}, \ldots, \vec{p}_{r}\right\}, \mathrm{r}<\mathrm{m}$.
  Then the point in $\mathrm{S}$ closest to $\mathrm{Q}$ is given by

- $$
  S=\left(\vec{p}_{1}\left|\vec{p}_{2}\right| \cdots \mid \vec{p}_{\gamma}\right)\left(\frac{\frac{\vec{p}_{1}}{\vec{p}_{2}}}{\frac{\vdots}{\vec{p}_{y}}}\right) Q
  $$
