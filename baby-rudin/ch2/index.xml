      <description>youtube bilibili note pdf xopp 2.43 Theorem Let \(P\) be a nonempty perfect set in \(R^{k}\). Then \(P\) is uncountable.
Proof Since \(P\) has limit points, \(P\) must be infinite. Suppose \(P\) is countable, and denote the points of \(P\) by \(\mathbf{x}_{1}, \mathbf{x}_{2}, \mathbf{x}_{3}, \ldots\) We shall construct a sequence \(\left\{V_{n}\right\}\) of neighborhoods, as follows.
Let \(V_{1}\) be any neighborhood of \(\mathbf{x}_{1}\). If \(V_{1}\) consists of all \(\mathbf{y} \in R^{k}\) such that \(\left|\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{x}_{1}\right|&amp;lt;r\), the closure \(\bar{V}_{1}\) of \(V_{1}\) is the set of all \(\mathbf{y} \in R^{k}\) such that \(\left|\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{x}_{1}\right| \leq r\).</description>

      <description>youtube bilibi note pdf xopp 2.45 Definition Two subsets \(A\) and \(B\) of a metric space \(X\) are said to be separated if both \(A \cap \bar{B}\) and \(\bar{A} \cap B\) are empty, i.e., if no point of \(A\) lies in the closure of \(B\) and no point of \(B\) lies in the closure of \(A\).
\(A\) set \(E \subset X\) is said to be connected if \(E\) is not a union of two nonempty separated sets.</description>

      <description>youtube bilibili note pdf xopp We begin this section with a definition of the function concept.
2.1 Definition Consider two sets \(A\) and \(B\), whose elements may be any objects whatsoever, and suppose that with each element \(x\) of \(A\) there is associated, in some manner, an element of \(B\), which we denote by \(f(x)\). Then \(f\) is said to be a function from \(A\) to \(B\) (or a mapping of \(A\) into \(B\) ).</description>

\(d(p, q)&amp;gt;0\) if \(p \neq q ; d(p, p)=0\);</description>

2.32 Definition A subset \(K\) of a metric space \(X\) is said to be compact if every open cover of \(K\) contains a finite subcover.</description>
