This post is a notation for myself.

line function 

$$
ax + by + c = 0
$$

vector (a,b) is normal vector for this line,
c is the bias for this line.

and more we can regard it as a plane.

$$ 
ax + by + cz = d
$$
where z = 1 and d = 0.

vector (a, b, c) is normal vector for the plane.


we can calculate distance between point and line easily by following equation.

$$
\frac{|ax_1 + by_1 + c|}{\|(a, b)\|}
$$

this can conduct from a simple graph by using projection.

I found following link might be useful it reader knowing nothing about liner function.
