      <title>7 THE STONE-WEIERSTRASS THEOREM</title>

      <description>7.26 Theorem If \(f\) is a continuous complex function on \([a, b]\), there exists a sequence of polynomials \(P_{n}\) such that \[ \lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} P_{n}(x)=f(x) \] uniformly on \([a, b]\). If \(f\) is real, the \(P_{n}\) may be taken real.
This is the form in which the theorem was originally discovered by Weierstrass.
Proof We may assume, without loss of generality, that \([a, b]=[0,1]\). We may also assume that \(f(0)=f(1)=0\).</description>

      <description>In Theorem \(3.6\) we saw that every bounded sequence of complex numbers contains a convergent subsequence, and the question arises whether something similar is true for sequences of functions. To make the question more precise, we shall define two kinds of boundedness.
7.19 Definition Let \(\left\{f_{n}\right\}\) be a sequence of functions defined on a set \(E\).
We say that \(\left\{f_{n}\right\}\) is pointwise bounded on \(E\) if the sequence \(\left\{f_{n}(x)\right\}\) is bounded for every \(x \in E\), that is, if there exists a finite-valued function \(\phi\) defined on \(E\) such that</description>

      <title>5 UNIFORM CONVERGENCE AND DIFFERENTIATION</title>

      <description>We have already seen, in Example 7.5, that uniform convergence of \(\left\{f_{n}\right\}\) implies nothing about the sequence \(\left\{f_{n}^{\prime}\right\}\). Thus stronger hypotheses are required for the assertion that \(f_{n}^{\prime} \rightarrow f^{\prime}\) if \(f_{n} \rightarrow f\).
7.17 Theorem Suppose \(\left\{f_{n}\right\}\) is a sequence of functions, differentiable on \([a, b]\) and such that \(\left\{f_{n}\left(x_{0}\right)\right\}\) converges for some point \(x_{0}\) on \([a, b]\). If \(\left\{f_{n}^{\prime}\right\}\) converges uniformly on \([a, b]\), then \(\left\{f_{n}\right\}\) converges uniformly on \([a, b]\), to a function \(f\), and \[ f^{\prime}(x)=\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} f_{n}^{\prime}(x) \quad(a \leq x \leq b) .</description>

      <title>2 UNIFORM CONVERGENCE</title>

      <description>7.7 Definition We say that a sequence of functions \(\left\{f_{n}\right\}, n=1,2,3, \ldots\), converges uniformly on \(E\) to a function \(f\) if for every \(\varepsilon&amp;gt;0\) there is an integer \(N\) such that \(n \geq N\) implies
\[ \left|f_{n}(x)-f(x)\right| \leq \varepsilon \]
for all \(x \in E\).
It is clear that every uniformly convergent sequence is pointwise convergent. Quite explicitly, the difference between the two concepts is this: If \(\left\{f_{n}\right\}\) converges pointwise on \(E\), then there exists a function \(f\) such that, for every \(\varepsilon&amp;gt;0\), and for every \(x \in E\), there is an integer \(N\), depending on \(\varepsilon\) and on \(x\), such that (12) holds if \(n \geq N\); if \(\left\{f_{n}\right\}\) converges uniformly on \(E\), it is possible, for each \(\varepsilon&amp;gt;0\), to find one integer \(N\) which will do for all \(x \in E\).</description>

      <title>3 UNIFORM CONVERGENCE AND CONTINUITY</title>

      <description>7.11 Theorem Suppose \(f_{n} \rightarrow f\) uniformly on a set \(E\) in a metric space. Let \(x\) be a limit point of \(E\), and suppose that \[ \lim _{t \rightarrow x} f_{n}(t)=A_{n} \quad(n=1,2,3, \ldots) . \] Then \(\left\{A_{n}\right\}\) converges, and \[ \lim _{t \rightarrow x} f(t)=\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} A_{n} . \]
In other words, the conclusion is that
\[ \lim _{t \rightarrow x} \lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} f_{n}(t)=\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \lim _{t \rightarrow x} f_{n}(t) .</description>

      <description>7.16 Theorem Let \(\alpha\) be monotonically increasing on [a, b]. Suppose \(f_{n} \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)\) on \([a, b]\), for \(n=1,2,3, \ldots\), and suppose \(f_{n} \rightarrow f\) uniformly on \([a, b]\). Then \(f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)\) on \([a, b]\), and \[ \int_{a}^{b} f d \alpha=\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \int_{a}^{b} f_{n} d \alpha . \]
(The existence of the limit is part of the conclusion.)
**Proof* It suffices to prove this for real \(f_{n}\). Put</description>

      <description>In the present chapter we confine our attention to complex-valued functions (including the real-valued ones, of course), although many of the theorems and proofs which follow extend without difficulty to vector-valued functions, and even to mappings into general metric spaces. We choose to stay within this simple framework in order to focus attention on the most important aspects of the problems that arise when limit processes are interchanged.</description>

      <description>7.1 Definition Suppose \(\left\{f_{n}\right\}, n=1,2,3, \ldots\), is a sequence of functions defined on a set \(E\), and suppose that the sequence of numbers \(\left\{f_{n}(x)\right\}\) converges for every \(x \in E\). We can then define a function \(f\) by \[ f(x)=\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} f_{n}(x) \quad(x \in E) . \]
Under these circumstances we say that \(\left\{f_{n}\right\}\) converges on \(E\) and that \(f\) is the limit, or the limit function, of \(\left\{f_{n}\right\}\).</description>
