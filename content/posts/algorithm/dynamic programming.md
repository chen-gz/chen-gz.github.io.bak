## Abstract

Dynamic Programming is a very important topic in Computer Science, Operations research, Reinforcement learning, and so on.

When different areas people talk about dynamic programming, they may have a different understanding of dynamic programming. This post will give a mathematical definition of dynamic programming and give some examples of programming algorithms. In the future, I will like to write some dynamic programming in control theory (optimal control) and reinforcement learning.
