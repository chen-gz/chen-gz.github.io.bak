read the post <https://www.deeplearning.ai/ai-notes/initialization/index.html> and <https://cs230.stanford.edu/section/4/>

This two post is enough to understand the Xavier initialization. 

The Newer initialization is proposed by Kaiming He, A modified version of Xavier.

Here is the link of the paper.  <https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/html/He_Delving_Deep_into_ICCV_2015_paper.html>

For more information of initializer refer to TensorFlow document. <https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/initializers>
