## 2.14 Theorem

Let $X$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space, and let $\Lambda$ be a positive linear functional on $C_c(X)$. Then there exists a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathfrak{M}$ in $X$ which contains all Borel sets in $X$, and there exists a unique positive measure $\mu$ on $\mathfrak{M}$ which represents $\Lambda$ in the sense that
(a) $\Lambda f=\int_X f d \mu$ for every $f \in C_c(X)$, and which has the following additional properties:
