### 1.22 

Throughout integration theory, one inevitably encounters $\infty$. One reason is that one wants to be able to integrate over sets of infinite measure; after all, the real line has infinite length. Another reason is that even if one is primarily interested in real-valued functions, the lim sup of a sequence of positive real functions or the sum of a sequence of positive real functions may well be $\infty$ at some points, and much of the elegance of theorems like $1.26$ and $1.27$ would be lost if one had to make some special provisions whenever this occurs.
Let us define $a+\infty=\infty+a=\infty$ if $0 \leq a \leq \infty$, and

$$
\begin{equation}
a \cdot \infty=\infty \cdot a= \begin{cases}\infty & \text { if } 0<a \leq \infty \\ 0 & \text { if } a=0\end{cases}
\end{equation}
$$

sums and products of real numbers are of course defined in the usual way.
It may seem strange to define $0 \cdot \infty=0$. However, one verifies without difficulty that with this definition the **commutative, associative, and distributive laws** hold in $[0, \infty]$ **without any restriction.**

The cancellation laws have to be treated with some care: $a+b=a+c$ implies $b=c$ only when $a<\infty$, and $a b=a c$ implies $b=c$ only when $0<a<\infty$. Observe that the following useful proposition holds:

If $0 \leq a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \cdots, 0 \leq b_1 \leq b_2 \leq \cdots, a_n \rightarrow a$, and $b_n \rightarrow b$, then $a_n b_n \rightarrow a b$

If we combine this with Theorems $1.17$ and $1.14$, we see that **sums and products of measurable functions into $[0, \infty]$ are measurable.**
