**1.23 Definition** The extended real number system consists of the real field $R$ and two symbols, $+\infty$ and $-\infty$. We preserve the original order in $R$, and define

for every $x \in R$.

$$
-\infty<x<+\infty
$$

It is then clear that $+\infty$ is an upper bound of every subset of the extended real number system, and that every nonempty subset has a least upper bound. If, for example, $E$ is a nonempty set of real numbers which is not bounded above in $R$, then $\sup E=+\infty$ in the extended real number system.

Exactly the same remarks apply to lower bounds.

The extended real number system does not form a field, but it is customary to make the following conventions:

(a) If $x$ is real then

$$
x+\infty=+\infty, \quad x-\infty=-\infty, \quad \frac{x}{+\infty}=\frac{x}{-\infty}=0 .
$$

(b) If $x>0$ then $x \cdot(+\infty)=+\infty, x \cdot(-\infty)=-\infty$.

(c) If $x<0$ then $x \cdot(+\infty)=-\infty, x \cdot(-\infty)=+\infty$.

When it is desired to make the distinction between real numbers on the one hand and the symbols $+\infty$ and $-\infty$ on the other quite explicit, the former are called finite.
