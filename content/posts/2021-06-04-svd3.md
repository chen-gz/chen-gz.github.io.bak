# Coordinates



## From standard coordinates to perpframe coordinates.

Here's a perpframe together with the point $P=\{1, \frac{1}{2}\}$.

Use a matrix hit to find numbers a and $\mathrm{b}$ so that $P=a v_{1}+b v_{2}$.

(The numbers a and b are the perpframe coordinates of the point P.) 

Why does that work?

**Answer:** Here's what you get when you hit everything in the plot above with the aligner matrix:

The location of the rotated point *aligner. P* relative to the xy-axis is the same as the location of the original point *P* relative to the perpframe. 

But in this picture it's clear that the numbers a and b should be the x and y coordinates of the point *aligner.P.*

## From perpframe coordinates to standard coordinates.

For the perpframe shown below, use a matrix hit to find the xy-coordinates of the point P that has perpframe coordinates {-2,3}.

Answer: The column method for matrix multiplication tells you that the standard $x y$ -coordinates of the point $P$ are given by $-2 v_{1}+3 v_{2}=\left(v_{1} \mid v_{2}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}-2 \\ 3\end{array}\right)$

## Summary

- A hit with the aligner matrix takes standard coordinates to perpframe coordinates.
- A hit with the hanger matrix takes perpframe coordinates to standard coordinates.

Exercises
1. Estimate by eye the $\{v_{1}, v_{2}\}$ coordinates of the point $\mathrm{P}$ shown in the plot below.
2. In terms of $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ express a matrix $\mathrm{M}$ so that $M P$ gives the coor$\{v_{1}, v_{2}\}$ dinates of the point $\mathrm{P}$.
