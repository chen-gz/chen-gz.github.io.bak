**manifold**: By an $n$-dimensional **manifold** we mean a connected Hausdorff space $M$ such that each point has a neighborhood which is homeomorphic to a ball in $R^n$â€‹.  We sometimes express this by saying that a manifold is a connected Hausdorff space which is locally Euclidean. (real analysis)

**Hausdorff space:** In [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology) and related branches of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), a **Hausdorff space**, **separated space** or **T2 space** is a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space) where for any two distinct points there exist [neighbourhoods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_(mathematics)) of each which are [disjoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_sets) from each other.(wiki)

**homeomorphic**: Continuous, one-to-one, in surjection, and having a continuous inverse. (Wolfram Mathworld)
