      <description>7.22 Definitions Suppose \(V\) is an open set in \(R^k, T\) maps \(V\) into \(R^k\), and \(x \in V\). If there exists a linear operator \(A\) on \(R^k\) (i.e., a linear mapping of \(R^k\) into \(R^k\), as in Definition 2.1) such that \[ \lim _{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{|T(x+h)-T(x)-A h|}{|h|}=0 \] (where, of course, \(h \in R^k\) ), then we say that \(T\) is differentiable at \(x\), and define \[ T^{\prime}(x)=A \text {.</description>

      <description>7.16 This theorem concerns functions defined on some compact interval \([a, b]\) in \(R^1\). It has two parts. The first asserts, roughly speaking, that the derivative of the indefinite integral of a function is that same function. We dealt with this in Theorem 7.11. The second part goes the other way: one returns to the original function by integrating its derivative. More precisely \[ f(x)-f(a)=\int_a^x f^{\prime}(t) d t \quad(a \leq x \leq b) .</description>

      <title>Derivatives of Measures</title>

      <description>We begin with a simple, theorem whose main purpose is to motivate the definitions that follow.
7.1 Theorem Suppose \(\mu\) is a complex Borel measure on \(R^1\) and
\[ f(x)=\mu((-\infty, x)) \quad\left(x \in R^1\right) . \]
If \(x \in R^1\) and \(A\) is a complex number, each of the following two statements implies the other:
\(f\) is differentiable at \(x\) and \(f^{\prime}(x)=A\). To every \(\epsilon&amp;gt;0\) corresponds a \(\delta&amp;gt;0\) such that \[ \left|\frac{\mu(I)}{m(I)}-A\right|&amp;lt;\epsilon \]</description>
