This post summary two papers, [DatasetGAN][1], [EditGAN][2].

### Dataset GAN

Dataset GAN proposed use GAN to generate segmentation data. 

Advance: Only few label image (40) can training the segmentation branch. 

Drawback: Only for those image which can be modeled by GAN.

#### Network structure

This network is based on styleGAN, it add a classification branch for segmentation. 

>The key insight of DATASETGAN is that generative
>models such as GANs that are trained to synthesize highly
>realistic images must acquire semantic knowledge in their
>high dimensional latent space.
