In elementary Calculus we learn that integration and differentiation are inverses of each other. This fundamental relation persists to a large extent in the context of the Lebesgue integral. We shall see that some of the most important facts about differentiation of integrals and integration of derivatives can be obtained with a minimum of effort by first studying derivatives of measures and the associated maximal functions. The Radon-Nikodym theorem and the Lebesgue decomposition will play a prominent role.
