There is already a post about R-CNN paper. Previous one is R-CNN note just for myself.

In this post I will explain the idea of R-CNN and make it very easy to understand.

[paper link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.2524.pdf)

![Object detection system overview. Our system (1) takes an input image, (2) extracts around 2000 bottom-up region proposals, (3) computes features for each proposal using a large convolutional neural network (CNN), and then (4) classifies each region using class-specific linear SVMs.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chen-gz/picBed/master/20210218195118.png)

The system contains 3 parts. The first part is the region proposal algorithm. R-CNN adopts selective search as its region proposal algorithm. I did not dig through this algorithm yet. The output of selective search is 2000 proposals. This proposal will be used later.

The second part is the CNN feature extractor. R-CNN using VGG-16 as a feature extractor. It only applies to 5 stages in VGG16. It does not contain a fully connected layer. The result from the last convolution layer is the image features.

The proposed region can be any size. But a fully connected layer or SVM requires fixed input. So wrap the region is required before feeding the region into the CNN feature extractor. After warping the region, the size of the input of CNN will be fixed. For VGG16 the dimension of the input image is 227x227. The author discusses several methods in the paper Appendix. I will not explain more here.

The output of the CNN features extractor is 4000 features for each region. The last part of the system is SVM classifier. As we know SVM generally works as a binary classifier. If we want it to become multiple classifiers, we need to build multiple binary classifiers. Then use all of these to determine the class. For example, we have an SVM classifier that can distinguish where the picture is aeroplane. We can use this classifier to tell where the region is aeroplane or not. So the final layer is SVMs as the classifier.

Up to here, the basic idea has already been explained. The original paper introduces a lot of tricks and gives explanations why they did that.
