**5.14 Definition** If $f$ has a derivative $f^{\prime}$ on an interval, and if $f^{\prime}$ is itself differentiable, we denote the derivative of $f^{\prime}$ by $f^{\prime \prime}$ and call $f^{\prime \prime}$ the second derivative of $f$. Continuing in this manner, we obtain functions
$$
f, f^{\prime}, f^{\prime \prime}, f^{(3)}, \ldots, f^{(n)},
$$

each of which is the derivative of the preceding one. $f^{(n)}$ is called the $n$th derivative, or the derivative of order $n$, of $f$.

In order for $f^{(n)}(x)$ to exist at a point $x, f^{(n-1)}(t)$ must exist in a neighborhood of $x$ (or in a one-sided neighborhood, if $x$ is an endpoint of the interval on which $f$ is defined), and $f^{(n-1)}$ must be differentiable at $x$. Since $f^{(n-1)}$ must exist in a neighborhood of $x, f^{(n-2)}$ must be differentiable in that neighborhood.
